Now BioArchLinux has the GPG keyring package called `bioarchlinux-keyring` and we have our mirrorlist package called `bioarchlinux-mirrorlist`.

Now add repository just need to add our repository information to `/etc/pacman.conf` and then `pacman -Sy && pacman -S bioarchlinux-keyring` then you can use our repository.

You can edit `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.bio` to use the mirror you want to use.
