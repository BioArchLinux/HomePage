Today, we first release our [monthly iso image](https://repo.bioarchlinux.org/iso/), everyone can use it just like using archiso, however, the only difference is that you need to replace `base` with `base-bio`.

For using the iso, you can check [the README page of the iso project](https://github.com/BioArchLinux/iso).

Again, this iso is not a joke.
