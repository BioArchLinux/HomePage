With contribution of [sinsong](https://github.com/sinsong), we now have our own pkg search web, you can find it [here](https://bioarchlinux.org/packages).

The frontend service is written in Vue providing web.

The backend service is written in Lua providing API.

API of our repo is also provided. `bioarchlinux.org/api/pkglist.json` is the list of all pkgs in our repo. `bioarchlinux.org/api/${pkgname}.json` is every single pkg's info.
